### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Guy, and I love writing code. <br >

I'm an enterprise developer by day, working mainly with C# and TypeScript.

Before transitioning to software development I was a mathematician. After a few years of learning the ropes, I have lately come full cirlce and am delightfully discovering the deep connections between type theory, category theory and logic.

Those explorations have lead me to functional programming. F# is one of my more recent - but probably long-lasting -  passions.

I love using the command line, and hence, lot's of my projects turn out to be CLI-related. I especially like to solve goofy things with them, like [wordles](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/wordle-assistant), [countles](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/countle-solver) or write [poker simulations](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/CardGames).

The project I am currently most excited about is: 

#### [**SpectreCoff**](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/SpectreCoff) - _Spectre Console for FSharp_. A thin, opinionated wrapper around [Spectre Console](https://https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console).

If you want to use the Spectre.Console.CLI in your F# console application, you can use my [starter template](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/fsharp-spectre-console-template) to get started quickly.
