### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Guy, and I love writing code. <br >

I'm an enterprise developer by day, working mainly with C# and TypeScript, and an open source enthusiast by night, lately addign a lot of F# to the mix!

Before transitioning to software development I was a physicist and mathematician. After a few years of learning the ropes, I have lately come full cirlce and am delightfully discovering the deep connections between type theory, category theory and logic. Those explorations have lead me to functional programming. Naturally, I'm not scared of the monad, hehe.

I love using the command line, and hence, lot's of my projects turn out to be CLI-related. I especially like to solve goofy things with them, like [wordles](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/wordle-assistant), [countles](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/countle-solver) or write [poker simulations](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/CardGames).

However, the project I am currently most excited about is: 

* [**SpectreCoff**](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/SpectreCoff) - _Spectre Console for FSharp_. A thin, opinionated wrapper around [Spectre Console](https://https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console).

If you want to use the Spectre.Console.CLI in your F# console application, you can use my [starter template](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/fsharp-spectre-console-template) to get started quickly.

I also created and maintain the website of my pool billiards club, _Billardfabrik Leipzig e.V._, including a module for our bi-weekly tourney series and leaderboard. If you're looking for a solution for your club, feel free to grab (parts of) it:

 * [**Github**](https://github.com/EluciusFTW/billardfabrik-web)
 * [**Actual Website**](https://www.billardfabrik-leipzig.de/)
